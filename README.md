## Why?
Many software libraries already exist to analyze birdsong in the wild.

In neuroscience, songbirds provide a model system to understand how the brain learns and produces a complex motor skill with many similarities to speech. 
Songbirds learn their song during a critical period in development from an adult "tutor". Their brains contain a specialized network of areas required for learning and producing song.
Although this network, known as the song system, is found only in songbird brains, it has evolved on top of the basic floor plan that appears in all vertebrate brains, including humans.
By understanding the song system, we can understand more about our own brain.

Often neuroscientists carry out behavioral experiments to investigate specific aspects of how the songbird brain learns and produces song. To analyze results from these experiments, the scientists must "label" the element of birdsong by hand.

hybrid-vocal-classifier is an attempt to provide a framework to compare different methods that have been proposed to automate the process of labeling birdsong for analysis of behavioral experiments.
