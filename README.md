![finch singing with annotated spectrogram of song](./docs/images/gr41rd41_song.png)

### Getting Started
You can install with pip: `$ pip install hybrid-vocal-classifier`  
For more detail, please see: https://hybrid-vocal-classifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#install

### Project Information
the `hybrid-vocal-classifier` library (`hvc` for short) 
facilitates the application of machine learning algorithms 
to animal vocalizations and bioacoustics data. 
You can think of it as a high-level wrapper around 
the `scikit-learn` library, combined with some built-in 
functionality for working with annotated animal sounds.

`hvc` was originally developed in [the Sober lab](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/soberlab/) 
as a tool to automate annotation of birdsong (as shown in the picture above). 
It grew out of a submission to the 
[SciPy 2016 conference](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2016/david_nicholson.html) 
and later developed into a library, 
as presented in this talk: https://youtu.be/BwNeVNou9-s
