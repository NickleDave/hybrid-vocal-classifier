    Computes spectogram of raw song waveform using FFT.
    Defaults to FFT parameters from Koumura Okanoya 2016.
    **Note that spectrogram is log transformed (base 10), and that
    both spectrogram and freq_bins are "flipped" (reflected across horizontal
    axis) so that when plotted the lower frequencies of the spectrogram are 
    at 0 on the y axis.

    Inputs:
        wav_file -- filename of .wav file corresponding to song
        size -- of FFT window, default is 512 samples
        step -- number of samples between the start of each window, default is 32
            i.e. if size == step then there will be no overlap of windows
        freq_range -- range of frequencies to return. Two-element list; frequencies
                      less than the first element or greater than the second are discarded.
    Returns:

        time_bins -- vector assigning time values to each column in spect
            e.g. [0,8,16] <-- 8 ms time bins
